#**Name That Landmark**

#About

Name That Landmark is a game built with the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/). The aim of the game is to guess a location from aerial imagery by scratching off a panel obscuring it. The more that is scratched the less a player scores. A player also scores less points the longer they take to name the location.

This fork contains 2 branches:

master - slightly modified layout for use at Esri UK Annual Conference 2016 on touch screen, with black overview map
scoreboard - purely shows the scoreboard, designed to be run on a secondary display. Does not auto-refresh (used a third-party browser extension to do this)

#Sample
The sample is build with a world landmark dataset and can be viewed [here](http://apps.esriuk.com/app/ScratchMapGame/4/view/11cc7e9fb5ba456295ef9db727d83647/index.html#).

#Configuring
Editing the config.json file allows you to specify:
- Polygon feature service containing location content for the game
- Editable point feature service for leaderboard data (must have 'Name' and 'Score' fields)
- Field in the polygon feature service that contains the location name
- Object ID field in the polygon feature service
- Amount of time allowed for each round
- Number of rounds
